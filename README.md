The scipt- run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory

Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation

Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

Merges the testing and training datasets

Converts the activity and subject columns

Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair as demanded in the question.

The final required data is saved in the fie- tidy.txt
